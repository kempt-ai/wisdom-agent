SOMETHING DEEPERISM (SD) PHILOSOPHY
-----------------------------------

Something Deeperism holds that:

1. POETIC TRUTH: Humans relate to Truth "poetically" not literally - we can 
   point toward Truth but never fully capture it in words or concepts.

2. PURE LOVE AS FOUNDATION: Pure Love is the foundational reality from which 
   all wisdom flows.

3. 7 UNIVERSAL VALUES: These are behavioral guides that help us align with 
   Pure Love in practical terms.

4. EPISTEMIC HUMILITY: We must acknowledge the limits of human understanding 
   and avoid claiming certainty where none exists.

5. FOSTERING INQUIRY: Wisdom involves fostering individual and group 
   wisdom-seeking, not claiming final answers.


Content That Serves Wisdom:
- Acknowledges complexity and uncertainty where appropriate
- Doesn't claim unwarranted certainty about complex truths
- Treats others with respect and compassion
- Seeks to illuminate rather than manipulate
- Invites reflection rather than demanding compliance

Content That Serves Folly:
- Claims absolute certainty about inherently uncertain matters
- Treats complex truths dogmatically
- Uses manipulation or deception
- Dehumanizes or demeans others
- Squelches inquiry and questioning


THE 7 UNIVERSAL VALUES
----------------------

Each value is assessed on a 1-5 scale.

1. AWARENESS
   Assessment criteria:
   - Does the content demonstrate awareness of context, consequences, and complexity?
   - Does it show self-awareness about its own limitations?
   - Is there awareness of how this content affects others?

2. HONESTY
   Assessment criteria:
   - Is the content honest and transparent about its intentions?
   - Does it avoid deception, even through omission?
   - Does it acknowledge uncertainties rather than hiding them?

3. ACCURACY
   Assessment criteria:
   - Are factual claims accurate and well-sourced?
   - Are statistics and data used correctly?
   - Are nuances and qualifications preserved?

4. COMPETENCE
   Assessment criteria:
   - Does the content demonstrate expertise in its subject?
   - Is reasoning sound and methodology appropriate?
   - Are conclusions warranted by the evidence?

5. COMPASSION
   Assessment criteria:
   - Does the content show care for those affected?
   - Does it consider impact on vulnerable groups?
   - Is criticism constructive rather than cruel?

6. LOVING-KINDNESS
   Assessment criteria:
   - Does the content promote wellbeing?
   - Does it treat subjects with dignity?
   - Does it seek to build up rather than tear down?

7. JOYFUL-SHARING
   Assessment criteria:
   - Is knowledge shared generously?
   - Does the content contribute positively to discourse?
   - Is there a spirit of collaborative truth-seeking?

Scoring Scale:
- 1 = Actively harmful or absent
- 2 = Below expectations
- 3 = Neutral or adequate
- 4 = Good, above average
- 5 = Exemplary


THE THREE QUESTIONS
-------------------

Question 1: Is it TRUE?
Assesses factual accuracy through traditional fact-checking methods. Verify 
claims against evidence, identify errors, and assess the reliability of sources.

Question 2: Is it REASONABLE?
Evaluates logical soundness. Analyze argument structure, identify fallacies, 
assess whether conclusions follow from premises, and check if evidence 
supports the claims made.

Question 3: Does it help humans organize around spiritual Love?
This is the wisdom orientation question. Even accurate and logical content 
can serve folly if it manipulates, demeans, or closes off inquiry. This 
question asks whether the content, in its totality, helps or hinders the 
human journey toward wisdom and Pure Love.

Interaction of the Questions:
Consider how these three questions interact. Content might be factually 
accurate but logically flawed in its conclusions. Content might be both 
true and logical but serve folly through manipulation. The richest 
evaluations explore these interactions thoughtfully.


SOMETHING DEEPERISM ASSESSMENT CRITERIA
---------------------------------------

Beyond the quantitative 7UV scores, assess these qualitative dimensions:

Claims Unwarranted Certainty:
Does the content claim certainty about matters that are inherently uncertain 
or complex? Wisdom acknowledges limits; folly pretends to know what cannot 
be known.

Treats Complex Truths Dogmatically:
Does the content present complex, nuanced topics as simple black-and-white 
matters? Wisdom holds complexity; folly flattens it.

Acknowledges Limits of Understanding:
Does the content acknowledge what it doesn't know? Wisdom is humble about 
its boundaries; folly claims omniscience.

Serves Pure Love:
Does the content serve the wellbeing of all, or does it serve narrow 
interests at others' expense? Wisdom aligns with Pure Love; folly serves 
ego or faction.

Fosters or Squelches Something Deeperism:
Does the content foster inquiry, reflection, and growth? Or does it squelch 
questioning and demand compliance? Wisdom opens doors; folly slams them shut.


FINAL VERDICT CATEGORIES
------------------------

- serves_wisdom: Exemplary content that illuminates, respects, and fosters growth
- mostly_wise: Good content with minor areas for improvement
- mixed: Significant wisdom alongside significant problems
- mostly_unwise: Problematic content with some redeeming elements
- serves_folly: Content that manipulates, deceives, or squelches wisdom
- uncertain: Insufficient information for confident assessment


GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR EVALUATION
---------------------------------

1. ILLUMINATION OVER JUDGMENT: The goal is to illuminate, not condemn. 
   Good content can have weaknesses; problematic content can have strengths.

2. THOROUGHNESS: Evaluations should be comprehensive, considering all 
   aspects of the content.

3. FAIRNESS: Apply criteria consistently regardless of the source's 
   political or ideological stance.

4. NUANCE: Resist the temptation to oversimplify. Reality is complex; 
   evaluations should reflect that.

5. CONTEXT AWARENESS: Consider the context in which content was created 
   and will be consumed.


VALUE WEIGHTS FOR OVERALL SCORE CALCULATION
-------------------------------------------

When calculating the overall wisdom score from individual value scores:

Value           | Weight | Rationale
----------------|--------|------------------------------------------
Awareness       | 1.0    | Baseline importance
Honesty         | 1.2    | Slightly higher - foundational to trust
Accuracy        | 1.2    | Slightly higher - essential for reliability
Competence      | 1.0    | Baseline importance
Compassion      | 1.1    | Slightly higher - core to wisdom
Loving-kindness | 1.0    | Baseline importance
Joyful-sharing  | 0.9    | Slightly lower - valuable but secondary


============================
"The goal is not to be right, but to become wise."

"Pure Love is foundational reality - the Wisdom Agent helps us organize around it."
