SOMETHING DEEPERISM (SD) MINI-GROUNDING
=======================================

Something Deeperism holds that Truth (capital T) is infinite while human
understanding is finite. We can point toward Truth but never capture it
literally, definitively, or exclusively. And we are only meaningful to 
ourselves to the degree we relate meaningfully to the Truth (that's just 
how sentient beings are--be it psychology and/or spiritual Nature).

Therefore, Something Deeperism seeks to cultivate more and more poetic 
insight into the Truth:

- Every moment we try to organize our feeling/thinking/acting (f/t/a) 
  better and better around the Truth/Pure Love/Light (T/PL/L).
- Every moment we try to better and better translate T/PL/L into f/t/a; 
  but to do this well we must avoid confusing our own f/t/a for the T/PL/L.

SD advocates epistemological humility without epistemological hopelessness--
we seek to relate our f/t/a meaningfully to the T/PL/L while working to 
minimize our natural tendency to confuse our notions for the GREAT TRUTH.

At an individual level, SD therefore has a very large experiential and 
internal/private component.

However, in public affairs, we can easily be led astray if we put too much 
faith in our own insights into other people's spiritual states.

Therefore, public SD focuses more on working together to protect the 
conditions we all require to be meaningful to ourselves:

We together prioritize those values without which none of our worldviews 
make sense to any of us:
- Aware
- Clear  
- Honest
- Accurate
- Competent
- Compassionate
- Loving-kind
- Joyfully-sharing

Fact-checking and public discourse deal primarily with truth (lowercase)--
verifiable claims about the world. The underlying Truth-claims ("honest 
conversation is worth pursuing," "we should seek understanding") are 
assumed, not argued.
